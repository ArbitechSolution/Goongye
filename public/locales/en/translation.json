  "landing.para": "The Goongye, the ruthless founder of the country, has transcended humanity and has become a higher being. He has transformed into the Crazy Ape Goongye, with knowledge beyond the fathomable concepts of man. Through his teachings, the Ape Goongye aims to create a new civilization that is efficient and prioritizes reason more than emotions.",

  "stroy.paraback1": "When the Goongye was still in his human form, he was a ruthless tyrant that led his people to victory. His country overcame war against various enemies through the use of deadly force and objective decisions. The Goongye showed no mercy to his enemies but was a good ally to his friends. He never abandoned a partner in battle nor let his worst enemies survive a fight. As he gained more knowledge to understand the world and become more powerful, he came upon the forbidden book – The Necronomicon.",
  "stroy.paraback2": "The Goongye was thirsty for knowledge and power which led him to ignore the warnings of his council and read the forbidden book. He spent weeks in his room, reading and analyzing each page and text. When he emerged from his weeks of seclusion, he was not a man anymore. He has become the Ape Goongye; a higher being that values reason and objectivity beyond anything else.",

  "storyCarousel.para2": "The Ape Goongye and some of the allies entered a heated argument regarding violent tactics and securing the safety of civilians.",
  "storyCarousel.scene3": "Scene#3",
  "storyCarousel.para3": "The Ape Goongye realizes that his allies want to destroy the Western countries and take over their territory. Since he is not a ruthless tyrant anymore, he decides to leave his position as a leader and left civilization.",
  "storyCarousel.scene4": "Scene#4",
  "storyCarousel.para4": "Now, the Ape Goongye travels the world as a stranger that teaches men about peace and the sanctity of life. The Eastern and Western countries are in a constant war but the Ape Goongye decides to ignore the violence.",
